IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

✓ SUBJECT LINE MUST BE EXACT
  Type it EXACTLY as shown (capitals matter)
  Wrong: "get products" or "Get Products"
  Right: "GET products" ✓

✓ SEND FROM YOUR ADMIN EMAIL
  Only the email in your .env can use commands
  If your admin email is john@example.com, ONLY send from john@example.com
  Other emails will NOT work

✓ WAIT 5-10 SECONDS
  The system needs a few seconds to process your email
  Don't send the same command twice
  Just wait and check your inbox

✓ RESPONSES COME AS REPLY EMAILS
  Look for a reply TO YOUR EMAIL
  It comes from the system
  Check SPAM folder if you don't see it

✓ BODY CONTENT MATTERS FOR SOME COMMANDS
  GET commands: Body can be empty
  PUSH commands: Body MUST have the product data
  UPDATE commands: Body MUST have the new value
  MARK commands: Body can be empty

✓ NO SPECIAL FORMATTING NEEDED
  Don't use HTML or fancy formatting
  Just plain text emails
  Everything is handled automatically

✓ PRODUCT FORMAT IS STRICT
  Copy the JSON format EXACTLY
  Don't add extra spaces or commas
  If it doesn't work, copy again from examples

✓ IMAGES MUST BE URLS
  "image": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
  NOT a file path like "C:\photos\photo.jpg"
  Must start with https://

✓ PRICES ARE IN CENTS
  "price": 2999 means $29.99
  "price": 100 means $1.00
  Don't include dollar signs or decimal points

SECURITY NOTE
================================================================================

ONLY THE ADMIN EMAIL WORKS

If you try these commands from a different email:
  ❌ They will NOT work
  ❌ You will NOT get a response
  ❌ Your commands are ignored

This is GOOD - it means only YOU can control your store via email.

If someone else tries to send commands, nothing happens.

Your store is safe.
